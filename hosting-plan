    - Users who don't need custom server configurations
- Medium size application
  - VPS Hosting (Virtual Private Server Hosting)
  - VPS hosting uses virtualization technology to partition a single physical server into multiple virtual servers, each operating independently with dedicated 
    resources.
  - Features
    - Dedicated Resources: Each VPS has its own allocated CPU, RAM, and disk space, independent of other VPSs on the same physical server.
    - Root Access: Users have root or administrative access to their VPS, allowing them to configure the environment and install custom software.
    - Scalability: VPS can be easily scaled by upgrading resources as needed.

    - Cloud hosting uses a network of connected servers (the cloud) to host websites and applications. Instead of relying on a single server, resources are 
      distributed across multiple servers.
    - This provide high availability, scalability, and redundancy.
    Feature:
      - Scalability: Resources can be scaled up or down easily based on demand, which is ideal for webistes with fluctuating traffic.
      - High Availability: If one server fails, others in the network take over, minimizing downtime.
      - Pay-As-You-Go: pay only for the resources they use, making it cost-effective for dynamic workloads.
      - Flexibility: Cloud hosting supports a wide range of configureations, making it suitable for diverse applications, from small webistes to complex, 
        resource-intensive applications.
    Useful for
      - Website and applications with variable or high traffic that require scalability. 
      - Businesses that need high availability and redundancy.
      - Application that require load balancing and distributed computing.
